EDA Analysis 

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics.

By using EDA, we can understand the dataset easily, find patterns, identify outliers and explore the relationship between variables by using non-graphical and graphical techniques.

EDA also helps us to choose which feature should be considered to use for our machine learning model. (aka feature selection)

Now, we know that Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a very important part of a data science project to understand data and get the intuition behind each variable.

In this post, I will be focusing on step-by-step exploratory data analysis to explain EDA smoothly and concisely.

## Conclusion
In this post, We examined our dataset using exploratory data analysis and try to understand each variable as well as their relationship with each other.

The main purpose of EDA is to help understand data before making any assumptions. EDA helps us to see distribution, summary statistics, relationships between variables and outliers.
